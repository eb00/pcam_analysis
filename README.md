This repository presents an exploratory analysis of the PCAM dataset, using
off-the-shelf deep learning libraries (tensorflow & keras).

PatchCamelyon (PCAM) is a public dataset of 327.680 images (96 x 96 px)
extracted from histopathologic microscope scans of lymph nodes sections.

Each image is annotated with a binary label indicating the presence of
metastatic (i.e. tumoral) tissue in the center of image. A positive value
indicates that the center 32 x 32 px region of the image contains at least one
pixel of tumor tissue. Note that tumor tissue in the outer region does not
influence the value of the label. 

The original dataset is divided into a training set of 262.144 examples, a
validation set of 32768 examples and a test set of 32.768 examples.

For more details on the dataset, please see the original [PCAM
repository](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam) on github.

This dataset was released as part of a scientific work by PhD student Bas
Veelin [1]. For the original Camelyon16 dataset paper, see [2].

It is worth noting that this dataset is slightly different from the [Kaggle
PCAM dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection), and
that the results are not the same.
